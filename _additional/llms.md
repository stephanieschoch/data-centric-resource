## Datasets
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14035.pdf">**ROOTS Search Tool: Data Transparency for LLMs**</a> \
*ROOTS is a 1.6TB multilingual text corpus developed for the training of BLOOM, currently the largest language model explicitly accompanied by commensurate data governance efforts. In continuation of these efforts, we present the ROOTS Search Tool: a search engine over the entire ROOTS corpus offering both fuzzy and exact search capabilities. ROOTS is the largest corpus to date that can be investigated this way.*
