# Large Language Models

This section is currently organized according to which stage of LLM training the data (or data-centric method) is applied to.

**Pretraining** and **Fine-tuning** contain papers related to curating, detecting, or analyzing data used for training.

**Model Evaluation** contains papers related to data-centric approaches to analyze LLMs (e.g. LLM reliability, biases, etc.).

**Outputs** contains papers related to analyzing outputs from LLMs (e.g. detecting machine-generated text) or using LLM as data generators.
