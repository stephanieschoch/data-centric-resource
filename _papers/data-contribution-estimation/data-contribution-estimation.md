# Data Contribution Estimation

Each category (e.g. Shapley, Influence, Other) contains "Methods" and "Applications" (and "Background", where applicable). "Methods" contains new methods and analyses of existing methods. "Applications" includes applications and methods applied to specific applications (e.g. data selection for LLMs). "Background" contains any relevant background knowledge, such as seminal research or analyses of the underlying method (e.g. analysis of Shapley axioms).
